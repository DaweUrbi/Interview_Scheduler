# Final Project - NodeJS - Interview Scheduler

## Description

Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) built with React that allows users to book, edit and cancel interviews.

Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

The client application communicates with an AsPI server over HTTP, using the JSON format.

Any updates can be seen in real time.

## Setup

- Install dependencies with `npm install`. You have 2 apps in this project, one for the client and one for the server. You will need to run `npm install` in `root` and `frontend` folders.
- Run the development web server using the `npm run server` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8000/>.
- Run the development web client using the `npm run client` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/>.
- The `npm run dev` command will run both the client and server with a single command.
